session auth just for sake of learning run surrealdb and run "make run" in terminal and enter http://localhost:8080/login to login
or enter http://localhost:8080/hi/[write whatever you want here because this is customizable] if you're logged in you will see your email password and session otherwise you'll be redirected to http://localhost:8080/login
